## Introduction

Fowl Prowl is a modern birding app that allows users to view multiple species of birds, catch the bird of the day and add favorite birds to their Lifers list! This project was given as a challenge to stretch our knowledge and self-teach a new technology we are interested in. We chose to study backend technologies and created an entire database and API. All of the data connected to this application was built by our team from the ground up.
